The GitHub repository you linked, [KeenGWatanabe/ExcelPasswordCracker](https://github.com/KeenGWatanabe/ExcelPasswordCracker), is a Java-based program designed to crack passwords for Excel files. Since I cannot directly access or execute code from external links, I can provide you with general guidance on how to analyze and deploy this Java program.

### **Understanding the Program**
1. **Purpose**: The program is likely a brute-force or dictionary-based password cracker for Excel files.
2. **Dependencies**: Check the `pom.xml` file (if it uses Maven) or `build.gradle` (if it uses Gradle) to identify dependencies. Common libraries for Excel manipulation in Java include Apache POI.
3. **Code Structure**: Review the source code in the `src` directory to understand how it works.

### **How to Deploy and Run the Program**

#### **Prerequisites**
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed.
   - Check your Java version: `java -version`
2. **Build Tool**: The project likely uses Maven or Gradle. Install the appropriate tool:
   - Maven: [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
   - Gradle: [Download Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
3. **Git**: To clone the repository.

#### **Steps to Deploy and Run**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KeenGWatanabe/ExcelPasswordCracker.git
   cd ExcelPasswordCracker
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   - If it uses **Maven**:
     ```bash
     mvn clean package
     ```
   - If it uses **Gradle**:
     ```bash
     gradle build
     ```

   This will compile the code and create a JAR file in the `target` (for Maven) or `build/libs` (for Gradle) directory.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Locate the generated JAR file and run it using Java:
     ```bash
     java -jar target/ExcelPasswordCracker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
     ```
   - If the program requires command-line arguments (e.g., the path to the Excel file), you can pass them like this:
     ```bash
     java -jar target/ExcelPasswordCracker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /path/to/excel/file.xlsx
     ```

4. **Follow Instructions**:
   - The program may prompt you for additional inputs, such as a dictionary file for password cracking or other options.

### **Additional Notes**
- **Ethical Use**: Ensure you have permission to crack the password of any Excel file you use this tool on. Unauthorized access to files is illegal and unethical.
- **Performance**: Brute-forcing passwords can be time-consuming, depending on the complexity of the password and the hardware you're using.
- **Customization**: You can modify the code to improve performance or adapt it to your specific needs.
